#Lydia Butterfly

##About

Lydia Butterfly is a speed-based color puzzle game, dedicated to my niece Lydia. The first version of this game was launched on April 11th, 2014, after about four and a half days of development as a project for [Omaha Code School](https://github.com/omahacodeschool).

###Other Tips

- Level 1 gives you 30 seconds to solve the puzzle. Each subsequent level decreases your time limit by 2 seconds, down to a minimum of 7 seconds.
- The computer will randomly change colors on the butterfly, so watch out!
- You can play as much as you would like without signing up, but if you do sign up, the game will keep track of your personal stats, and you will also be eligible for the high score table.
